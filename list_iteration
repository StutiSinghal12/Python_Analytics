List is equivalent to arrays in other languages, 
with the extra benefit of being dynamic in size. In Python, the list is a type of container in Data Structures, 
which is used to store multiple data at the same time. Unlike Sets, lists in Python are ordered and have a definite count.

-----****---
# Python3 code to iterate over a list
list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
   
# Using for loop
for i in list:
    print(i)
    
 ---****-----
 
# Python3 code to iterate over a list
list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
   
# getting length of list
length = len(list)
   
# Iterating the index
# same as 'for i in range(len(list))'
for i in range(length):
    print(list[i])
    
----*****-----
# Python3 code to iterate over a list
list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
   
# Using list comprehension
[print(i) for i in list]

---*******----
Using enumerate()
If we want to convert the list into an iterable list of tuples (or get the index based on a condition check, for example in linear search you might need to save the index of minimum element), you can use the enumerate() function. 


# Python3 code to iterate over a list
list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
   
# Using enumerate() 
for i, val in enumerate(list):
    print (i, ",",val)
    
 Output: 

0 , 1
1 , 3
2 , 5
3 , 7
4 , 9
